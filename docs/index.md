# Welcome to CodeBake

**Your Guide to AI-Native Project Management**

We're so glad you're here! This documentation is designed to help you get the most out of CodeBake, the project management platform built for the way modern development teams work.

## 📚 Where to Start

- **[Getting Started](Getting-Started.md)** - Jump right in! Set up your account and create your first project.
- **[Core Concepts](Core-Concepts.md)** - Learn how we organize things: accounts, projects, phases, and tasks.
- **[MCP Tools](MCP-Tools.md)** - The magic part: connect your AI assistant to automate your workflow.

## What is CodeBake?

CodeBake is a project management platform built specifically for developers who work with AI. We know that switching between your code editor and a separate project tracker breaks your flow. That's why we built CodeBake—to bring intelligent project management directly into your development workflow.

### Why You'll Love It

**🤖 No More Busywork**
Connect your favorite AI assistant (like AugmentCode, Cursor, or Claude Desktop) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Your AI handles the status updates for you, so you can stay in your flow and never have to manually move a ticket again.

**👀 Total Transparency**
Project managers and clients can see exactly what's happening at any time with our **Activity Summaries**. No more "what's the status?" meetings—it's all right there.

**🤝 Bring Everyone Along**
Add unlimited guests to your project for free. Give your clients and stakeholders a front-row seat to view status and add issues, keeping everyone in the loop without the friction.

**💻 It's Built for Developers**
We love tools that get out of the way. Enjoy real-time Kanban boards, Markdown everywhere, and keyboard shortcuts that let you fly through your work.

## How It Works

Think of CodeBake as a simple hierarchy:

```
Account (Your Organization)
  └── Projects (Your Initiatives)
      └── Phases (Milestones)
          └── Tasks (The Work)
```

Projects move through **Phases**, and tasks flow through statuses: `TODO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `REVIEW` → `DONE`. Simple, right?
