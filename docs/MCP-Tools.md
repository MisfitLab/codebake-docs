# MCP Tools

**Supercharge Your Workflow with AI**

CodeBake supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is a fancy way of saying we let your AI assistant talk directly to your project board. This is where the magic happens.

## What Does This Mean for You?

It means you can say goodbye to manual status updates. Instead of breaking your flow to alt-tab to a browser and move a ticket, you can just tell your AI (like Cursor or Zed) what you're doing, and it handles the paperwork. **Engineers save hours every week by letting the AI manage the board.**

**Note:** You don't need to configure any JSON or write any code to make this work. Your AI assistant is already trained to use these tools. You just need to connect them.

## What Your AI Can Do

Once connected, your AI assistant becomes a full member of your team. It can:

### 📋 Manage Your Projects
- **Find things**: "What projects am I working on?"
- **Get context**: "What's the current phase of the website redesign?"

### ✅ Handle Tasks
- **Create tasks**: "Add a task to fix the login bug."
- **Update status**: "Mark task WEB-123 as done."
- **Find work**: "What tasks are assigned to me?"
- **Move things along**: "Mark this task as completed."
    - which automatically adds a comment to the task of what was done
    - and marks it as ready for review

### 💬 Collaborate
- **Read comments**: "What did Sarah say about this ticket?"
- **Add notes**: "Add a comment that I'm investigating the API response."

## How to Use It

1. **Connect**: Go to your project settings and follow the steps to link your AI assistant.
2. **Chat**: Just talk to your AI like you would a teammate.

### Try saying things like:
- "Let's work on TASK-123"
- "What's on my plate today?"
- "Create a new task for the payment integration."
- "I finished WEB-42, move it to review."
- "Summarize the open tasks in this phase."

It's that simple. Happy coding!
