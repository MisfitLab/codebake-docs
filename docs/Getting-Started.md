# Getting Started with CodeBake
 
Welcome to CodeBake! We're excited to help you manage your projects more effectively. This guide will walk you through setting up your account and getting your first project off the ground.

## 1. Create Your Account

First things first, let's get you signed up.

1. Head over to [https://app.codebake.ai](https://app.codebake.ai).
2. Click **Sign Up**.
3. Enter your email or choose a sign-in provider.
4. You'll be asked to name your **Account** or **Organization**. This is the home for all your projects, so choose something that represents you or your team!

## 2. Create Your First Project

Now that you're in, let's create a space for your work.

1. Click the **New Project** button on your dashboard.
2. Give your project a **Name** (e.g., "Website Redesign").
3. Choose a **Task Prefix** (e.g., "WEB"). This is a short code that will appear on all your tasks (like `WEB-1`, `WEB-2`). It helps keep things distinct.
4. Click **Create Project**.

## 3. Invite Your Team

CodeBake is better together. Let's bring your team on board.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Members**.
2. Type in the email addresses of the people you want to invite.
3. Choose their role (Member or Admin).
4. Hit send! They'll get an email inviting them to join.

## 4. Connect Your AI Assistant

This is the best part. CodeBake is built to work *with* your AI tools.

1. Navigate to your project settings.
2. Follow the simple instructions to connect your preferred AI assistant (like [AugmentCode](https://www.augmentcode.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), or [Zed](https://zed.dev/)) using MCP.
3. Once connected, your AI becomes a superpower—it can create tasks, update statuses, and answer questions about your project context.
